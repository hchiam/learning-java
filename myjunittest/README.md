1) Download junit.jar and hamcrest-core.jar by clicking their names/links at: 
https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install

2) Save them in a directory.

3) If you're using Eclipse like me, then go through settings to put these two .jar files into the build path for this project. This is what I had to do: 

* Right-click on the project folder ('myjunittest') displayed inside Eclipse, in the Project Explorer.
* Select 'Properties'.
* Select 'Java Build Path' on the left side of the menu that appears.
* Click 'Add External JARs'.
* Navigate the folders to each of the .jar files above, and select them.
* Make sure to hit 'Apply' and then 'OK' in that same earlier menu that appeared to confirm the things added to the Java Build Path.
