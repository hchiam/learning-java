Original source for the code: Cracking the Coding Interview
https://github.com/careercup/ctci/tree/master/java/Chapter%204/Question4_2
I added comments for my own learning to understand the solution.

I recommend to myself:
Run the Question.java file in Eclipse, not in Terminal/Command-Line.

src contains .java files for editing code
bin contains .class files for running code
